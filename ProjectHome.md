A magnetic strip reader created using a Omron V3A-6 and a TI Launchpad development kit.

Launchmag includes the Launchpad firmware as well as a companion host software for interpreting the magnetic stripe data. The primary design goal was to create a USB magnetic stripe reader that could output the binary data on the magnetic stripe for the lowest hardware cost possible.
